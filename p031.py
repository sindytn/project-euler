"""
Find the number of ways to make Â£2 with the given coin denominations.

Approach:
Dynamic programming. Let f_c(x) be the number of ways to make x with coins of 
denomination c or lower. Let c_i be the i-th coin denomination. Then:

    f_{c_i}(x) = f_{c_{i-1}}(x) + f_{c_{i-1}}(x - c_{i-1}) + f_{c_{i-1}}(x - 2 * c_{i-1}) + ... 

We construct the DP table according to this formula and read the final value as our result.
